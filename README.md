# Google Cloud Threat Detection: A Study in Google Cloud - fwd:cloudsec
☁️ My [fwd:cloudsec](https://pretalx.com/fwd-cloudsec-2023/talk/ERSK7U/) slides covering several real-world Google Cloud Platform (GCP) attacks and highlighting how to use the available telemetry to identify and detect these attacks. In particular, it dives into tactics used by threat actors such as lateral movement, privilege escalation, data exfiltration and the types of event logging to aid the detection process.
